        //hosting is when javascript reads the code first, no metter where is it written. for example:
        //1
        greet();
        function greet() {
            console.log("Hello World!");
        }
        //2
        console.log(num);
        var num = 10;
         
        /*this is a problem because we can make mistakes and not know where is it, because error will not show,
        to fix this, we have to use const or let deppending what we want to achive. "const" creates constant,
        so whatever meaning we give it, will stay the same and wont be able to change it afterwards.
        "let" doeses same thing, but we have ability to change the meaning afterwards.
        const/let doesnt have hosting, meaning, its out way to fix hosting. for example: */
        let number = 5;
        console.log(number);

        //Function Expression is when we give function an name but using let or const. this is out way to fix hosting on functions, for example:
        const hi = function() {
            console.log("hi");
        };

        //function declaration is when we create function without using const or let, so it will have hosting. for example:
        function hello(){
            console.log("hello");
        };
