            Asynchronization is when code doesnt stop while some action is running
            synchronization is when code stops until some action is completed

            promise is result of an asynchronous action
            promise can have 3 states:
                1. Pending - when its in process
                2. resolved - when its completed successfully
                3. rejected - when its completed with an error

            here are some examples:
                1. downloading an app, at first its pending, we dont know if theres gonna be any erros while downloading so we are waiting, it could succeed or fail to downlaod. (promise is that this app might download or not)
                2. when we are creating new name for an account, we are waiting to see if our name is picked or not (pending state), then we find out if it was rejected (name already exists) or resolved (name is available). (promise is that this name might be available or not)
