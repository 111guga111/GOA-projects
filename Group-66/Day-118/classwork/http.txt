HTTP is responsible for request/response actions.
The user requests some action and receives data; HTTP acts as the messenger.

HTTP structure:

    Start line - Shows the request type (GET, POST, etc.)

    Headers - Contain extra information about the request or response (like content type, length, cookies)

    Body - The main content being sent or received (like HTML, JSON, or images)
    
.


A port is a number where specific requests go, so the user receives the specific data.
