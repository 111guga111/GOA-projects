TCP:
    sends data with three way handshake, it makes sure data is sent properly and nothing is lost with correct order.
    downside is the speed, it is slow, mostly used sending files or data that requires reliability rather then speed.
        example:
            if i want to send someone important message that needs to be send fully without any loss, i need tcp
.

UDP:
    sends data without handshake and doesnt guarantee if data is sent safely,
    but it is fast and is being used in games or videos.
        example:
            if i am playng a game and it lags, i want to continue where I am after the lag and dont need the lost data,
            so i need udp
.

TLS:
    its a security layer, that encrypts data so no one can read it while its being transferred.
        example:
            when i am sending my password that shouldnt be seen by public, i want it to be secure when sending data,
            if a hacker attacks and tries to read my message it has to be encrypted so it cant be read, so i need TLS.
