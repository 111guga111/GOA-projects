    <h1>Programming languages</h1>
    <p>In 1843, before the invention of computers, the first programming language was created by Ada Lovelace, one of the earliest female mathematicians.</p>
    <p>A programming language is a set of instructions written by a programmer to deliver instructions to the computer to perform and accomplish a task.
        Programming languages are low-level (close to hardware) or high-level (easier for humans). High-level languages include procedural, object-oriented, functional, and scripting types.
        there are 8,000+ programming languages, but only a handful are industry staples. Python, C++, Java, C, and C# are currently the most used languages.</p>
