    <h1>why saving the photo?</h1>
    <p>saving photo might seem extra steps to insert the image but thats far from the truth, reason why we should save a picture is simple.
        if we are working on a big project, its easyer to name the image small name and not only we can easly inset it, we can also identify witch picture we put it when we look back.
        another problem with copyng address is that theres a risk, picture might get deleted and so will the image on your web but if we download picture, we will no longer have to worry about it
