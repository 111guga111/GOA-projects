num = 2
print(f'Hello {num} world')#1 it gives you freedom on creating a sentence without doing extra 
print("Hello", num, "world")#2 this is good, we dont have to turn anything into ather data type
print("Hello " + str(num) + " world")#3 this is bad, we do lot of extra steps and we have to turn variables into ather data types
